  "description": "The Emperium is one of the more prominent groups on the server, gaining the spotlight after the fall of the Spawn Masons and the Peacekeepers during the summer of 2017. Founded by TheDark_Emperor, The Emperium grew slowly, and carefully selected members. Even in their infancy they turned away people who did not meet their criteria. The symbol of the group is the Omega, which they pridefully plaster wherever they go. Its symbol is the last and 24th letter of the Greek alphabet.",
