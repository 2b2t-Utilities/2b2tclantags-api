  "description": "The Jew Masons were founded by v999 and FarmerJoe after the Spawn Masons made their discord public and offered membership to anyone that bought discord nitro and boosted their discord. The Jew Masons offered pay to join ranks, up to $300, to mock the spawn masons, although the ranks were given free to the leaders friends.. They were advertised by its members in the spawn mason discord and other 2b2t discords and rapidly gained several hundred members. In October of 2019, FarmerJoe removed the pay to join ranks and began advertising the group again, increasing activity. A priority queue giveaway was started for people with 10 or more invites to the Jew Mason discord, and it encouraged more people to advertise. A 5 invite requirement was added to join, but it was removed later because it caused the number of recruits to decrease drastically. As of 12/29/2019, Jew Mason recruitment and membership is at an all time high, and is continuing to increase.",
